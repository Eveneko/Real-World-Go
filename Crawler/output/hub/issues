    "body": "**The problem I'm trying to solve:**\r\n\r\nWhen I review a PR I do not deal with the fork's branch name. Also when I check out a PR locally with:\r\n```\r\nhub pr checkout 123\r\n```\r\nI don't deal with the branch name and that is great. But this currently creates a branch, which is named after the fork's branch, which is also the first time I am seeing it. What is worse:\r\n\r\n1. this branch can be in conflict with already existing branch, which I think then leads to https://github.com/github/hub/issues/2448 (and any behavior discussed there for refreshing is even more dangerous - albeit I think it is needed) , especially with simple branch names like `fix`, `typo` or the GitHub autogenerated ones like `patch`\r\n2. it makes orientation in the repo much harder, because of course not everyone keeps the same naming and sometimes (see above) the branch names are total garbage, this is problematic especially when you need to keep more PRs for longer time\r\n3. after you check it out, you can no longer find it by the PR number, which is what you have been working with the whole time, what you you while referencing in other issues/PRs etc.\r\n\r\n**How I imagine hub could expose this functionality:**\r\n\r\nIt would be much clearer if the branch names would be in format: `pr-123`. Even better would be `pr-123-<branch-name>` because then you can see what branches are PRs and you can find the branch both by the number or by the feature name.\r\n\r\nI can of course provide my own name (`hub pr checkout 123 pr-123`), but it is more typing, I have to repeat the same twice plus I do not know the branch name so in case it is useful I am missing out on that.\r\n\r\nThis could also unlock some more functionality, because AFAIK currently after the branch is created the PR number is nowhere, so no other work can be done with the branch? Or am I missing something? If there was such a convention as I am proposing it would be similar as the current name `upstream` and its usage by the commands.",

    "body": "I've only recently discovered this, but `remote.pushDefault` pairs really well with the typical GitHub open source workflow. All my pushes go to my fork, but my pulls come from the upstream. It's the missing piece of a puzzle I've been trying to solve for years. I think this excellent pairing, coupled with the fact Git itself doesn't provide a good high level way to set this option, make it an good candidate for inclusion in Hub itself. (It's also difficult to implement externally, as figuring out the name of the remote `hub fork` created is nontrivial.)\r\n\r\nSee also #2139, which attempted to add this as the *default* `fork` behavior, and was (rightfully, imo) rejected for being too disruptive.  Mentioned in the rejection is `push -u` as a possible alternative workflow. This sets the *upstream*, which is great for a branch that one intends to collaborate on with others, but for a typical forked repository, doesn't really have much value as a default `git pull` target, as nobody but you will be pushing to it.",
